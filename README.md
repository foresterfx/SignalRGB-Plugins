# SignalRGB-Plugins
Just my plugins for SignalRGB for my hardware. Use at your own risk.

The GPU plugin is a modified version of the SignalRGB native plugin. It changes the default image of the MSI GPU.

To change your own, go here:

then upload your photo and copy the base64 to the javascript file in place of the old at the end of each plugin file.
